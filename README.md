# Rock_Paper_Scissor
Rock paper scissor game using python:
     A simple game we have all played can be played with a 
     computer and also in your  phone by a simple python script 
     that has been coded in the RPS.py file.
     It is pretty simple to understand as it is not at all
     a complex code.
